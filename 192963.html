				<h2 class="my-welcome"> Welcome to flowers by Floor.</h2>
				
				<p class="my-introduction">On this page I will explain a bit about myself and my passion for flowers.<br>
				I hope you will be as excited I am about flowers<br>
				​My name is Floor Verhoeven. I am 22 years old and I live in a student house with 3 other girls in Breda. I was born in Son & Breugel, Netherlands, but after my 18th birthday, we moved to Eindhoven the "big" city where I developed my passion for flowers. After I graduated from my my previous study "SintLucas" I wanted to do something else and started with the study Creative Business at Breda University of Applied Sciences. And I want to combine my little flowershop with some creative business insides.</p><br>

			  <div><p class="pinky">Floor: What kind of promotion are you most exposed to in everyday life? Which channels and which brands? It could be anything except art Pleunie : Via the radio, television, and newspaper. I usually watch informative and educational advertising  Floor: Can you be open to a completely different and new way of promoting art? Pleunie : Yes, if it is conveyed in a good way, I am certainly open to this!  Floor: If you sell your art do you think the promotion will help you sell your artwork, or have you experienced this? Pleunie : When I look at my sales after it has been exhibited at a gallery, they are considerably higher. because then the gallery owner also tells a story about my work. Word of mouth is the most prolific promotional tool for me </p></div>
	
			  <p class="grey"><span id="zaza">Floor: We have researched this and, according to the information gap theory, states that curiosity arises when a consumer notices a gap between what the consumer knows and what the consumer wants to know. Do you feel that if the artists made a video more mysterious, you would be more interested? </span>Pleunie : Yes, of course, then you will be curious to see the entire artwork. I think it is a very nice way of presenting art.Floor: How would you like to interact with a sculptor through social media? Pleunie : I have a lot of contact with sculptors through social media. It is a small world so you have a lot of contact with everyone. We share tips and tricks. Regarding the potential buyers on social media, I think it is very nice that they can easily find me and that I can approach them warmly using a personal message.</p>
